# Dynamic Category Implementation Summary

## Overview
Updated the homepage category grid to display accurate product counts and rotating product images with smooth transitions.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Real-time Product Counts
- **Before**: Static hardcoded counts (e.g., "15+ items")
- **After**: Dynamic counts based on actual products in database (e.g., "6+ items" for Dream Catcher)
- Shows "Coming Soon" for categories with 0 products

### 2. Rotating Product Images
- **Image Rotation**: Images change every 2 seconds with smooth transitions
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS-based fade and scale effects
- **Fallback Handling**: Default images when no product images available
- **Visual Indicators**: Dots showing current image in rotation

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loading while fetching data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing images
- **Hover Effects**: Enhanced card hover animations
- **Responsive Design**: Works across all device sizes

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. **`src/services/categoryService.ts`**
   - Fetches product data grouped by category
   - Returns count and images for each category
   - Handles database errors gracefully

2. **`src/components/RotatingCategoryImage.tsx`**
   - Manages image rotation with 2-second intervals
   - Smooth fade/scale transitions
   - Visual indicators for multiple images
   - Error handling for broken images

3. **`scripts/testCategoryService.cjs`**
   - Test script to verify category data fetching
   - Shows product counts and images per category

### Modified Files
1. **`src/components/CategoryGrid.tsx`**
   - Integrated dynamic data fetching
   - Added loading states
   - Replaced static images with rotating component
   - Enhanced hover effects

2. **`src/index.css`**
   - Added smooth animation keyframes
   - Enhanced hover transition effects
   - Loading state animations

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. **CategoryGrid** component loads and calls `fetchCategoryData()`
2. **categoryService** queries Supabase for products grouped by category
3. **RotatingCategoryImage** displays images with smooth transitions
4. Real-time counts displayed in category cards

### Animation Details
- **Transition Duration**: 300ms for image changes
- **Rotation Interval**: 2000ms (2 seconds)
- **Effects**: Fade + scale for smooth transitions
- **Indicators**: Dots showing current image position

### Database Integration
- Queries `products` table filtering by `in_stock = true`
- Groups by `category` field
- Extracts `images` array for each category
- Counts products per category

## Current Category Data (Test Results)
```
Dream Catcher: 6 products, 3 images

## Benefits
1. **Accurate Information**: Users see real product availability
2. **Visual Appeal**: Rotating images showcase actual products
3. **Better UX**: Smooth animations and loading states
4. **Maintainable**: Automatically updates as products are added/removed
5. **Performance**: Efficient database queries and image handling

## Future Enhancements
- Add click-to-pause on image rotation
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Add category-specific animations
- Cache category data for better performance
