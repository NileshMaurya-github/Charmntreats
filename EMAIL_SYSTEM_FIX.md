# Email System Fix - COD Orders

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved

The issue was that the email system wasn't working because:
1. API routes (`/api/send-order-confirmation`) don't work in Vite development mode
2. The checkout page was calling API endpoints that weren't being served

## âœ… Solution Implemented

### 1. **Created Direct Email Service** (`/src/services/orderEmailService.ts`)
- Bypasses API routes and calls Brevo directly from the frontend
- Works in both development and production
- Sends both customer and store emails
- Professional Flipkart-style invoice design

### 2. **Updated Checkout Page** (`/src/pages/Checkout.tsx`)
- Now uses the direct email service instead of API endpoints
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Shows success/failure messages for email sending
- Continues with order even if emails fail
